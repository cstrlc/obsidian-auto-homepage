# Obsidian Auto Homepage Plugin

## Warning ⚠️

This is still a work in progress project. There are a lot of features that I am still working on. Do not use it on your main vault yet.

## About

This plugin automatically creates a homepage for your vault. It will iterate through all your notes on a folder and
create a `Home` note with links for all of them. This will also link all of them on the graph.

## Todo

Improve documentation.
